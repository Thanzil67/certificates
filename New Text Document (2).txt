Why We Need driver:



The driver object represents the browser session created by WebDriver.
When you create an instance of JavascriptExecutor, you need to cast the driver to this interface.
This allows you to access the executeScript method, which executes JavaScript code.




An object repository is a common storage location where we store a collection of all required application objects and their properties123.
 In Selenium WebDriver context, objects would typically be the locators used to uniquely identify web elements2. 
The major advantage of using object repository is the segregation of objects from test cases2. The Object Repository ensures the management, reusability, 
and reliability of UI elements by capturing them as objects in a DOM-like repository, sharable across projects
